Final project repository for National Grasslands S Nutans Habitat Assessment

### Grassland Management Under Climate Change

#### A workbook for Sorghastrum nutans's habitat suitability model. 

In this project I will analyze multiple data layers that relate to Sorghastrum nutans habitat in North America. I will focus on USFS National Grassland Units as my study sites to better understand the link between habitat and variables like soil, topography, and climate. The Forest Service defines 20 National Grasslands across 13 different states that provide ecosystem services to over a million visitors annually.Value estimates of aesthetic and passive use of such ecosystems total millions of dollars (~280) yearly. Climate change threatens the continued suitability of certain species that play an important role in preserving grassland integrity and valuable ecosystem servies.  
[(USFS)](https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/national-forests-grasslands/national-grasslands/ecoservices).

In this workbook, I chose Oglala National Grassland (NE) and Fort Pierre National Grassland (SD). My decision was based on comparable shape (contiguous not fragmented), location (SD-NE), acreage (94,480 vs 115,997).
- Oglala National Grassland is a unique area created by water and wind erosion on layers of siltstone and clay. The area is dominated by native mixed-grass prairie[(USFS)](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/nebraska/recarea/?recid=30328).
- Fort Pierre National Grassland consists of flats and gently rolling hills with large drainages that are essential for waterfowl habitat and popular fisheries. Furthermore, it is widely known for its mixed grass prairie vegetation [(USFS)](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/nebraska/recarea/?recid=10637).

The Jupyter Notebook grassland_final contains the code that runs the analyses.
